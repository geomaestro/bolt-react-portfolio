# Web Fundamentals Every Developer Should Know

Understanding web fundamentals is crucial for building better websites. These core concepts form the foundation of modern web development.

## HTML Semantics

Using semantic HTML elements helps improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability. Choose elements that accurately describe their content's meaning.

## Progressive Enhancement

Start with a solid HTML foundation and layer on CSS and JavaScript. This ensures your site works for everyone, regardless of their device or connection speed.

## Performance Considerations

* Minimize HTTP requests
* Optimize images and assets
* Use appropriate caching strategies
* Implement lazy loading where appropriate

## Accessibility

Make your websites accessible to everyone by following WCAG guidelines, using proper ARIA attributes, and ensuring keyboard navigation works correctly.

# Building Resilient User Interfaces

Creating resilient user interfaces is essential for delivering reliable web applications that can handle various edge cases and user interactions gracefully.

## Error Boundaries

Implement error boundaries to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully, preventing entire application crashes and providing meaningful feedback to users.

## Loading States

Design meaningful loading states that maintain layout stability and provide visual feedback during data fetching or processing operations.

## Offline Support

* Implement service workers for offline functionality
* Cache critical resources
* Handle network failures gracefully
* Sync data when connection is restored

## Form Handling

Build robust form handling with proper validation, error messages, and submission states. Always provide clear feedback and maintain data integrity.
